# Https Server

> An HTTPS server with a built-in router.

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@panosoft/https-server.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@panosoft/https-server)
[![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/panosoft/https-server.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/panosoft/https-server)

This module can be used to create an HTTPS server that can route requests to a pre-defined set of handlers. It also provides an interface that makes it trivial to run such a server from the command line.

Each request received is assigned a unique id that is included in all associated log entries and is returned to the requester in the `Request-Id` header of the response.

If a request is received for an unhandled pathname or method the server will log the occurrence and respond with the proper HTTP response codes.

Similarly, if an error is encountered while handling a defined route, the occurrence will be logged and the proper HTTP response will be sent to the requester.

# Installation

```sh
npm install @panosoft/https-server
```

# Usage

The [`cli`](#cli) method can be used to quickly create a server that can be run from the command line:

```js
#! /usr/bin/env node

const HttpsServer = require('@panosoft/https-server');

const packageFilename = '/path/to/top-level/pacakge.json';
const routes = {
  '/': { GET: (request, response, log) => response.end('Hello World') }
};

HttpsServer.cli(packageFilename, routes);
```

Or, the API can be used directly:

```js
const bunyan = require('bunyan');
const fs = require('fs');
const HttpsServer = require('@panosoft/https-server');

const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('path/to/key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('path/to/cert.pem'),
  logger: bunyan.createLogger({name: 'server'})
};
const routes = {
  '/': { GET: (request, response, log) => response.end('Hello World') }
};
const server = HttpsServer.create(options, routes);

yield server.listen(8443, '127.0.0.1');
server.address();
yield server.connections();
yield server.close();
```

# Routes

An object that determines how requests will be routed and handled. It has the following structure:

```js
{
  <pathname> : {
    <method>: <handler>,
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

Where:

- `pathname` - {String} Any valid path.

- `method` - {String} Any valid HTTP method.

- `handler` - {Function}

  A function to be called when the specified pathname and method are requested.

  This function will be called with the `request` and `response` streams generated by Node's [`https.Server`](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_class_https_server) along with a Bunyan logger that includes the serialized request with every log entry.

  This function should handle the entire request, write any necessary log entries, and call `response.end()` when it has completed.

  This function will be run asynchronously if it returns a `Promise`. Otherwise, it will be run synchronously.

  In the case of synchronous handlers, when an error is encountered, it should be thrown.

  In the case of asynchronous handlers, when an error is encountered the returned `Promise` should be rejected with the error.

  All handler errors will be automatically be logged by the server and an HTTP error response will automatically be sent to the requester.

__Example__

```js
const routes = {
  '/': {
    GET: (request, response, log) => {}
  },
  '/user': {
    GET:(request, response, log) => {},
    POST: (request, response, log) => {},
    DELETE: (request, response, log) => {}    
  }
};
```

# API

## cli ( packageFilename , routes )

Run the server as a node command line program.

Help and version commands are automatically generated using the contents of the `package.json` file found at the provided path.

Log entries are written to `stdout` and `stderr` as appropriate.

Also, the following process events are also handled gracefully and appropriately (i.e. open connections are closed and appropriate exit codes are returned by the process):

- `SIGINT`

- `SIGTERM`

- `unhandledRejection`

- `uncaughtException`

When run as a command the following interface is available:

```sh
Usage: server-name --key <path> --cert <path> [options]

<Description from package.json>

Options:

  -h, --help                    output usage information
  -V, --version                 output the version number
  -k, --key   <path>            Path to the private key of the server in PEM format.
  -c, --cert  <path>            Path to the certificate key of the server in PEM format.
  -p, --port  <port>            The port to accept connections on. Default: 8443.
  -i, --interface  <interface>  The interface to accept connections on. Default: 0.0.0.0.
```

__Arguments__

- `packageFilename` - {String} A path to the `package.json` for the module calling this function.

- `routes` - {[Routes](#routes)} A routes object.

__Example__

```js
#! /usr/bin/env node

const HttpsServer = require('@panosoft/https-server');

const packageFilename = '/path/to/top-level/pacakge.json';
const routes = {
  '/': { GET: (request, response, log) => response.end('Hello World') }
};

HttpsServer.cli(packageFilename, routes);
```

## create ( options , routes )

Create a new instance of HttpsServer.

__Arguments__

- `options`

  - `key` - (Required) {String} The private key of the server in PEM format.

  - `cert` - (Required) {String} The certificate key of the server in PEM format.

  - `logger` - {Bunyan Logger} An instance of a [Bunyan]() logger.

  - ... any other supported Node [https.Server]() options

- `routes` - {[Routes](#routes)} A routes object.

__Example__

```js
const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('path/to/key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('path/to/cert.pem'),
  logger: bunyan.createLogger({name: 'server'})
};
const routes = {
  '/': { GET: (request, response, log) => response.end('Hello World') }
};
const server = HttpsServer.create(options, routes);
```

## listen ( ... )

A thin wrapper around Node's [server.listen](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_server_listen_handle_callback) method that returns a `Promise` instead of taking a callback.

## address ( )

Equivalent to Node's [server.address](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_server_address) method.

## connections ( )

A thin wrapper around Node's [server.getConnections](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_server_getconnections_callback) method that returns a `Promise` instead of taking a callback.

## close ( )

A thin wrapper around Node's [server.close](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_server_close_callback) method that returns a `Promise` instead of taking a callback.

Also, this method differs from Node's [server.close](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_server_close_callback) in that it will not return an error if it is called while the server is not listening.
